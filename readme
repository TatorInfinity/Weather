A lightweight Bash script that monitors weather conditions and alerts you with audible beeps for severe weather. This tool logs forecasts and weather alerts for multiple U.S. ZIP codes or latitude/longitude coordinates.

**Disclaimer:** This script is **not** a replacement for official weather systems. It uses data from public APIs and should only be used for **logging or low-priority weather checks**. For emergencies, refer to the National Weather Service (NWS) or your local authorities.


## 📦 Features

* Monitor multiple ZIP codes or lat,lon coordinates.
* Alerts with sound when there's a **severe weather warning** (like Tornado, Flood, Storm).
* Logs forecast and alert info to a timestamped file.
* Text-to-speech announcement with `espeak`.
* Simple interactive terminal menu.

## 🛠 Requirements

Make sure the following tools are installed:

* `bash`
* `curl`
* `jq`
* `espeak` (for alert sound)

Install dependencies on Debian-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jq espeak curl
```

---

## 📂 Directory Structure

* `~/.weather_alert/locations.txt` — List of monitored ZIPs/coordinates.
* `~/.weather_alert/logs/` — Logs for each weather check.

   ```

2. **Options Menu:**

   ```
   1. Add location (ZIP or lat,lon)
   2. Remove location
   3. List saved locations
   4. Start monitoring (runs until stopped)
